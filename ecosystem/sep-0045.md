## Simple Summary

This SEP defines the standard way for clients such as wallets or exchanges to create authenticated web sessions on
behalf of a user who holds a Contract account. A wallet may want to authenticate with any web service which requires a
contract account ownership verification, for example, to upload KYC information to an anchor in an authenticated way as
described in [SEP-12](sep-0012.md).

This SEP also supports authenticating users of shared contract accounts. Clients can use [memos](#memos) to distinguish
users or sub-accounts of shared accounts.

This SEP is based on [SEP-10](sep-0010.md), but only supports contract accounts and aims to provide a JWT that is fully
compatible with existing protocols that use SEP-10.

## Abstract

This protocol is a variation of mutual challenge-response, which uses Soroban authorization entries to encode challenges
and responses.

It involves the following components:

- A **Home Domain**: a domain hosting a [SEP-1 stellar.toml](sep-0001.md) containing a `WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT_SEP0045` (URL)
  and `SIGNING_KEY` (`G...`).
- A **Server**: a server providing the `WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT_SEP0045` that implements the GET and POST operations discussed
  in this document. The server's domain may be the **Home Domain**, a sub-domain of the **Home Domain**, or a different
  domain.
  - The `SIGNING_KEY` from the **Home Domain** is the **Server Account**.
- A **Client Account**: the account being authenticated.
  - A Contract address (`C...`) that may be accompanied by a memo to scope the authentication to a user or sub-account
    of the account.
- A **Client**: the software used by the holder of the **Client Account** being authenticated by the **Server**.
- A **Client Domain** (optional): a domain hosting a [SEP-1 stellar.toml](sep-0001.md) containing a `SIGNING_KEY` used
  for [Verifying the Client Domain](#verifying-the-client-domain)
  - The `SIGNING_KEY` from this domain is the **Client Domain Account**
- A **Web Auth Contract**: a contract that implements the `web_auth_verify` function as described in this document. The
  contract must be deployed at the `WEB_AUTH_CONTRACT_ID` address specified in the **Server**'s `stellar.toml`.

The discovery flow is as follows:

1. The **Client** retrieves the `stellar.toml` from the **Home Domain** in accordance with
   [SEP-1 stellar.toml](sep-0001.md).
1. The **Client** looks up the `WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT_SEP0045`, `WEB_AUTH_CONTRACT_ID` and `SIGNING_KEY` (i.e. **Server
   Account**) from the `stellar.toml`.

The authentication flow is as follows:

1. The **Client** requests a unique [`challenge`](#challenge) from the **Server** which includes a list of Soroban
   authorization entries and the server's signatures represented as XDR strings.
1. The **Server** responds with the challenge.
1. The **Client** verifies that each authorization entry is signed by the **Server Account**.
1. The **Client** verifies that each authorization entry does not contain any sub-invocations.
1. The **Client** signs the first authorization entry using the secret key(s) of the signer(s) for the **Client
   Account**.
1. The **Client** obtains a signature from the **Client Domain Account** for the second authorization entry if the
   **Client** included a client domain in the request.
1. The **Client** submits the credentials along with the original challenge back to the **Server** using
   [`token`](#token) endpoint
1. The **Server** verifies the integrity of the authorization entries and server signatures returned by the **Client**
1. The **Server** verifies the last argument, the nonce, is the same across all authorization entries and is unique
1. The **Server** constructs a transaction with a single Invoke Host Function operation using the credentials and the
   challenge authorization entries returned by the client and simulates the transaction.
1. If the simulation succeeds, the **Server** responds with a [JWT](https://jwt.io) that represents the authenticated
   session

The flow achieves several things:

- Both **Client** and **Server** can be implemented using well-established Stellar libraries
- The **Client** can verify that the **Server** holds the secret key to the **Server Account**
- The **Server** can verify that the **Client** holds the secret key(s) to signer(s) of the **Client Account**
- The **Server** can choose its own timeout for the authenticated session
- The **Server** can choose to include other application-specific claims

## Authentication Endpoint

The organization with a **Home Domain** indicates that it supports authentication via this protocol by specifying
`WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT_SEP0045` in their [`stellar.toml`](sep-0001.md) file. This is how a wallet knows where to find the
**Server**. A **Server** is required to implement the following behavior for the web authentication endpoint:

- [`GET <WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT_SEP0045>`](#challenge): request a challenge (step 1)
- [`POST <WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT_SEP0045>`](#token): exchange a signed challenge for session JWT (step 2)

## Cross-Origin Headers

Valid CORS headers are necessary to allow web clients from other sites to use the endpoints. The following HTTP header
must be set for all authentication endpoints, including error responses.

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

In order for browsers-based wallets to validate the CORS headers, as
[specified by W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#preflight-request), the preflight request (OPTIONS request) must be
implemented in all the endpoints that support Cross-Origin.

### Challenge

This endpoint must respond with authorization entries signed by the **Server Account**. The **Client** can then sign the
entries using standard Stellar libraries and submit it to [`token`](#token) endpoint to prove that it controls the
**Client Account**. This approach is compatible with hardware wallets such as Ledger. The **Client Application** must
also verify the server's signature to be sure the challenge is signed by the **Server Account**, that the home domain
argument in the function invocation is the **Home Domain**, and that the web auth domain argument in the function
invocation is the **Server** domain.

#### Request

```
GET <WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT_SEP0045>
```

##### Request Parameters:

| Name            | Type          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Example:

```
GET https://auth.example.com/?address=CCIBUCGPOHWMMMFPFTDWBSVHQRT4DIBJ7AD6BZJYDITBK2LCVBYW7HUQ
```

#### Response

##### Success

On success the endpoint must return `200 OK` HTTP status code and a JSON object with these fields:

- `authorization_entries`: a list of XDR-encoded `SorobanAuthorizationEntry`. The first entry is must be signed by the
  **Client Account**. There is an optional second entry that must be signed by the **Client Domain Account** if the
  **Client** included a client domain in the request. Each entry's `root_invocation` function is a `contract_fn` with
  the following with no additional sub invocations:
  - `contract_address` is the `WEB_AUTH_CONTRACT_ID` from the **Server**'s `stellar.toml`
  - `function_name` is `web_auth_verify`
  - `args`:
    - `account` matches the **Client Account** from the request
    - `memo` matches the `memo` from the request
    - `home_domain` matches the `home_domain` from the request
    - `web_auth_domain` matches the **Server**'s domain
    - `client_domain` matches the **Client**'s domain
    - `client_domain_address` is the **Client Domain**'s address
- `server_signatures`: a list of hex encoded signatures of the `SorobanAuthorizationEntry` hashes by the **Server
  Account**. The signature at index `i` corresponds to the `SorobanAuthorizationEntry` at index `i`.
- `network_passphrase`: (optional but recommended) Stellar network passphrase used by the **Server**. This allows a
  **Client** to verify that it's using the correct passphrase when signing and is useful for identifying when a
  **Client** or **Server** have been configured incorrectly.

Example:

```json
{
  "authorization_entries": [
    "AAAAAQAAAAHw6CVqzY+dCq3myVJBo1kb3nEGE7oO6obmJeUNvYQ0uiUmvl6zrExtAAAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAAahbWC88MmIccL/85Jd6Myxjq5sHF+2dnq1+2H8osKvEAAAAD3dlYl9hdXRoX3ZlcmlmeQAAAAAHAAAAEgAAAAHw6CVqzY+dCq3myVJBo1kb3nEGE7oO6obmJeUNvYQ0ugAAAA4AAAADMTIzAAAAAA4AAAAObG9jYWxob3N0OjgwODAAAAAAAA4AAAAObG9jYWxob3N0OjgwODAAAAAAAAEAAAABAAAADgAAAAozMDc4NjE1NjE1AAAAAAAA"

##### Error

Every other HTTP status code will be considered an error. For example:

```json
{
  "error": "The provided account has requested too many challenges recently. Try again later."
}
```

### Token

This endpoint accepts a signed challenge transaction, validates it and responds with a session
[JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/) authenticating the account.

The **Client** submits a challenge (that was previously returned by the [`challenge`](#challenge) endpoint) as a HTTP
POST request to `WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT_SEP0045` using one of the following formats (both should be equally supported by the
server):

- Content-Type: `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, body:
  `authorization_entries=<XDR (URL-encoded)>,authorization_entries=<XDR (URL-encoded)>,server_signatures=<hex>,server_signatures=<hex>,credentials=<XDR (URL-encoded)>,credentials=<XDR (URL-encoded>`)
- Content-Type: `application/json`, body:
  `{"authorization_entries": ["<signed XDR>", "<signed XDR>"], "server_signatures": ["<hex>", "<hex>"], "credentials": ["<XDR (URL-encoded)>", "<XDR (URL-encoded>"]}`

To validate the challenge transaction the following steps are performed by the **Server**. If any of the listed steps
fail, then the authentication request must be rejected — that is, treated by the **Server** as an invalid input.

1. For each entry `i` in `authorization_entries`:
   1. decode the received input as a base64-urlencoded XDR representation of a `SorobanAuthorizationEntry`;
   1. verify that the `i`th signature corresponds to the `i`th authorization entry and was signed by the **Server
      Account**;
1. Construct a transaction with a single Invoke Host Function operation using the credentials and the challenge
   authorization entries returned by the client;
1. Simulate the transaction and verify that it succeeds.

The verification process confirms that the **Client** controls the **Client Account**. Depending on your application
this may mean complete signing authority, some threshold of control, or being a signer of the account. See
[Verification](#verification) for examples.

Upon successful verification, **Server** responds with a session JWT, containing the following claims:

- `iss` (the principal that issued a token, [RFC7519, Section 4.1.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.1))
  — a [Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)] for the issuer (`https://example.com` or `https://example.com/G...`)
- `sub` (the principal that is the subject of the JWT,
  [RFC7519, Section 4.1.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.2)) — there are several possible formats:
  - If a memo was attached to the challenge transaction, the `sub` should be the stellar account appended with the memo,
    separated by a colon (`C...:17509749319012223907`).
  - Otherwise, the `sub` value should be Stellar account (`C...`).
- `iat` (the time at which the JWT was issued
  [RFC7519, Section 4.1.6](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.6)) — current timestamp (`1530644093`)
- `exp` (the expiration time on or after which the JWT must not be accepted for processing,
  [RFC7519, Section 4.1.4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.4)) — a server can pick its own expiration
  period for the token (`1530730493`)
- `client_domain` - (optional) a nonstandard JWT claim containing the client home domain, included if the challenge
  transaction contained a `client_domain` (see [Verifying the Client Domain](#verifying-the-client-domain))

The JWT may contain other claims specific to your application, see [RFC7519].

The **Server** should not provide more than one JWT for a specific challenge transaction.

Every other HTTP status code will be considered an error. For example:

```json
{
  "error": "The provided transaction is not valid"
}
```

## Web Authentication Contract

The **Server** must deploy a contract at the `WEB_AUTH_CONTRACT_ID` address specified in the **Server**'s
`stellar.toml`. This contract allows the **Server** to customize authentication logic, including client domain
verification and nonce handling.

The contract must implement the `web_auth_verify` function with the following signature. Within this function, the
contract should call `require_auth` on the address to ensure the client has authorized the operation. If the Server
supports client domain verification, the contract can optionally require a signature from the `client_domain_address`.
All other arguments are ignored by the contract.

```rust
#[contract]
pub struct WebAuthContract;

#[contractimpl]
impl WebAuthContract {
    pub fn web_auth_verify(
        _env: Env,
        address: Address,
        _memo: Option<String>,            // IGNORED
        _home_domain: Option<String>,     // IGNORED
        _web_auth_domain: Option<String>, // IGNORED
        _client_domain: Option<String>,   // IGNORED
        client_domain_address: Option<Address>,
        _nonce: Option<String>,           // IGNORED, used by the server to prevent replay attacks
    ) {
        address.require_auth();
        // Optional: require a signature from the client domain address
        if let Some(client_domain_address) = client_domain_address {
            client_domain_address.require_auth();
        }
    }
}

To prevent unintended side effects in case the web_auth_verify invocation operation is executed on the network, the
**Client** should perform the following checks in addition to ensuring there are no sub-invocations in the authorization
entries:

### Verify Invocation Details

For each authorization entry, verify the following:

- **Contract ID**: Ensure it matches the `WEB_AUTH_CONTRACT_ID` specified in the Server's `stellar.toml`.
- **Function Name**: Confirm that the root invocation function is `web_auth_verify`.
- **Arguments**: Verify that the arguments (such as the client account, home domain, and server domain) match the
  expected values and are in the same order as described in the
  [Web Authentication Contract](#web-authentication-contract) section.

### Simulate the Transaction

Reconstruct the transaction using the authorization entries and simulate the transaction. By simulating the transaction,
the Client can verify:

- The ledger footprint's `read_write` set contains a single `contract_data` entry where the contract ID is the Client
  account and the key is `ledger_key_nonce`.

### Signature Expiration Ledger

When signing the authorization entries, the **Client** should set the signature expiration ledger to the current ledger
plus a reasonable buffer. This ensures the signature remains valid for an appropriate duration while preventing replay
attacks. Setting this to the current ledger plus 1 is a reasonable default.

## Verification

### Verifying the Client Domain

A web service requiring SEP-45 authentication may want to attribute each HTTP request made to it to a specific
**Client** software. For example, a web service may want to offer reduced fees for the users of a specific **Client**.

In order to use this optional feature, the organization that provides the **Client** must host a
[SEP-1 stellar.toml](sep-0001.md) file containing a `SIGNING_KEY` attribute (i.e. the **Client Domain Account** on the
**Client Domain**). The `SIGNING_KEY` attribute must be a Stellar public key in the form of a `G` address. The secret
key paired with the `SIGNING_KEY` should be protected as anyone in possession of the secret can verify the **Client
Domain**.

This setup allows the **Server** to verify that the challenge returned by the **Client** is also signed with the
**Client Domain Account**, proving that the **Client** is associated with the **Client Domain**. Web services requiring
SEP-45 authentication can now attribute requests made with the resulting JWT to the **Client Domain** that signed the
challenge.

**Servers** may chose which **Client Domains** to verify. If the **Client** requests verification of its domain but the
**Server** has no use for verifying that domain, the **Server** should proceed as if the **Client** did not provide the
domain in the request for the challenge transaction. If the **Server** attempts but is unable to fetch the `SIGNING_KEY`
from the provided **Client Domain**, the **Server** should return a `400 Bad Request` HTTP status code.

### Memos

Stellar transaction memos are used for a variety of purposes in the ecosystem, but in the context of this standard memos
attached to challenges distinguish sessions that should be entirely separate, scoped, and detached from each other. Two
users who are authenticated with the same Contract account but different memos should have the same level of separation
as two users who are authenticated with different Contract accounts. Typically the sessions are unique users who share a
single Contract account.

The `memo` parameter supported in `GET <WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT_SEP0045>` API calls is used to communicate to the **Server**
that the client intends to authenticate a Contract account with an additional claim that the account is shared and that
the user should be identified using the `address` and `memo` parameters, instead of only using `address`. The value of
the `memo` passed will ultimately be added to the decoded JWT's `sub` field, separated from the account address by a
colon (`:`).

## JWT Expiration

Servers should select an expiration time for the JWT that is appropriate for the assumptions and risk of the
interactions the **Client** can perform with it. A **Client** may be in control of an account at the time the JWT is
issued but they may lose control of the account through a change in signers. Expiration times that are too long increase
the risk that control on the account has changed. Expiration times that are too short increase the number of times
authentication must reoccur, and a user using a hardware signing device or who must complete a complex signing process
could have a poor user experience.

## A convention for signatures

Signatures in Stellar involve both the secret key of the signer and the passphrase of the network. SEP-45 clients and
servers must use the following convention when deciding what network passphrase to use for signing and verifying
signatures in SEP-45:

- If the server is for testing purposes or interacts with the Stellar testnet, use the Stellar testnet passphrase.
- Otherwise, use the Stellar pubnet passphrase.

This convention ensures that SEP-45 clients and servers can use the same passphrase as they're using for interacting
with the Stellar network.

The client can examine the `network_passphrase` (if defined) that the server includes in its response from the challenge
endpoint to be sure it's using the correct passphrase and is connecting to the server that it expected.

## JWT best practices

When generating and validating JWTs it's important to follow best practices. The IETF is in the process of producing a
set of best current practices when using JWTs: [IETF JWT BCP].
