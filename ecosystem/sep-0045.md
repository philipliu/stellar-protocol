## Simple Summary

This SEP defines the standard way for clients such as wallets or exchanges to create authenticated web sessions on
behalf of a user who holds a contract account. A wallet may want to authenticate with any web service which requires a
contract account ownership verification, for example, to upload KYC information to an anchor in an authenticated way as
described in [SEP-12](sep-0012.md).

This SEP is based on [SEP-10](sep-0010.md), but does not replace it. This SEP only supports `C` (contract) accounts. SEP-10 only `G` and `M` accounts. Services wishing to support all accounts should implement both SEPs.

## Definitions

- **Address**: An identifier representing a possible account on the Stellar network. Addresses begin with specific
  prefixes like G for public keys (accounts controlled by secret keys), M for muxed accounts and C for contract
  accounts.
- **Account**: A stateful entity on the Stellar network that can hold balances. This can refer to a Stellar account
  (`G...` address, or the `G...` base address of an `M...` address) or Soroban contract that abstracts an account (`C...` addresses).

## Abstract

This protocol is a variation of mutual challenge-response, which uses Stellar authorization entries to encode challenges
and responses.

It involves the following components:

- A **Home Domain**: a domain hosting a [SEP-1 stellar.toml](sep-0001.md) containing a `WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT_SEP0045` (URL)
  and `SIGNING_KEY` (`G...`).
- A **Server**: a server providing the `WEB_AUTH_FOR_CONTRACTS_ENDPOINT` that implements the GET and POST operations discussed
  - The `SIGNING_KEY` from the **Home Domain** is the **Server Account**.
  in this document. The server's domain may be the **Home Domain**, a sub-domain of the **Home Domain**, or a different
  domain.
- A **Client Account**: the account being authenticated.
  - A Stellar contract account (`C...`).
- A **Client**: the software used by the holder of the **Client Account** being authenticated by the **Server**.
- A **Client Domain** (optional): a domain hosting a [SEP-1 stellar.toml](sep-0001.md) containing a `SIGNING_KEY` used
  for [Verifying the Client Domain](#verifying-the-client-domain)
  - The `SIGNING_KEY` from this domain is the **Client Domain Address**
- A **Web Auth Contract**: a contract that implements the `web_auth_verify` function as described in this document. The
  contract must be deployed at the `WEB_AUTH_CONTRACT_ID` address specified in the **Server**'s `stellar.toml`.

The discovery flow is as follows:

1. The **Client** retrieves the `stellar.toml` from the **Home Domain** in accordance with
   [SEP-1 stellar.toml](sep-0001.md).
1. The **Client** looks up the `WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT_SEP0045`, `WEB_AUTH_CONTRACT_ID` and `SIGNING_KEY` (i.e. **Server Account**) from the `stellar.toml`.

The authentication flow is as follows:

1. The **Client** requests a unique [`challenge`](#challenge) from the **Server** which includes a list of Soroban
   authorization entries XDR-encoded strings
1. The **Server** responds with the challenge
1. The **Client** verifies that each authorization entry does not contain any sub-invocations
1. The **Client** signs the corresponding authorization entries using the secret key(s) of the signer(s) for the
   **Client Account**
   - Note: There may be no **Client** signatures required if the contract's `__check_auth` implementation does not
     require them
1. The **Client** obtains a signature from the **Client Domain Address** for the corresponding authorization entry if
   the **Client** included a client domain in the request
1. The **Client** simulates the transaction using the authorization entries and verifies that it succeeds.
1. The **Client** submits the signed entries back to the **Server** using [`token`](#token) endpoint
1. The **Server** verifies the last argument, the nonce, is the same across all authorization entries and is unique
1. The **Server** constructs a transaction with a single Invoke Host Function operation using the authorization entries
   returned by the client and simulates the transaction
1. If the simulation succeeds, the **Server** responds with a [JWT](https://jwt.io) that represents the authenticated
   session

The flow achieves several things:

- Both **Client** and **Server** can be implemented using well-established Stellar libraries
- The **Client** can verify that the **Server** holds the secret key to the **Home Domain Address**
- The **Server** can verify that the **Client** is authorized by the contract account to create an authenticated session
- The **Server** can choose its own timeout for the authenticated session
- The **Server** can choose to include other application-specific claims

## Authentication Endpoint

The organization with a **Home Domain** indicates that it supports authentication via this protocol by specifying
`WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT_SEP0045` in their [`stellar.toml`](sep-0001.md) file. This is how a wallet knows where to find the
**Server**. A **Server** is required to implement the following behavior for the web authentication endpoint:

- [`GET <WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT_SEP0045>`](#challenge): request a challenge (step 1)
- [`POST <WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT_SEP0045>`](#token): exchange a signed challenge for session JWT (step 2)

## Cross-Origin Headers

Valid CORS headers are necessary to allow web clients from other sites to use the endpoints. The following HTTP header
must be set for all authentication endpoints, including error responses.

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

In order for browsers-based wallets to validate the CORS headers, as
[specified by W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#preflight-request), the preflight request (OPTIONS request) must be
implemented in all the endpoints that support Cross-Origin.

### Challenge

This endpoint must respond with authorization entries to be signed by the **Client**. The **Client** signs the entries
using standard Stellar libraries and submit it to [`token`](#token) endpoint to prove that it controls the **Client
Account**. This approach is compatible with hardware wallets such as Ledger. The **Client Application** must also verify
the server's signature to be sure the challenge is signed by the **Home Domain Address**, that the home domain argument
in the function invocation is the **Home Domain**, and that the web auth domain argument in the function invocation is
the **Server** domain.

#### Request

```
GET <WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT_SEP0045>
```

##### Request Parameters:

| Name            | Type          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `address`       | `C...` string | The **Client Account** address (`C...`) that the **Client** wishes to authenticate with the **Server**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `home_domain`   | string        | A **Home Domain**. Servers that generate tokens for multiple **Home Domain**s can use this parameter to identify which home domain the **Client** hopes to authenticate with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `client_domain` | string        | (optional) a **Client Domain**. Supplied by **Clients** that intend to verify their domain in addition to the **Client Account**. See [Verifying the Client Domain](#verifying-the-client-domain). **Servers** should ignore this parameter if the **Server** does not support **Client Domain** verification, or the **Server** does not support verification for the specific **Client Domain** included in the request. |

Example:

```
GET https://auth.example.com/?address=CCIBUCGPOHWMMMFPFTDWBSVHQRT4DIBJ7AD6BZJYDITBK2LCVBYW7HUQ&home_domain=example.com
```

#### Response

##### Success

On success the endpoint must return `200 OK` HTTP status code and a JSON object with the following fields:

- `authorization_entries`: a list of XDR-encoded `SorobanAuthorizationEntry`. It contains an entry for each of the
  **Client Account**'s signers in addition to a signed entry from the **Home Domain Address** and optionally the
  **Client Domain Address**. The entries are not guaranteed to be in any specific order.

Each entry's `root_invocation` function is a `contract_fn` with the following with no additional sub invocations:

- `contract_address` is the `WEB_AUTH_CONTRACT_ID` from the **Server**'s `stellar.toml`
- `function_name` is `web_auth_verify`
- `args`:
  - `address` matches the `address` from the request
  - `home_domain` matches the `home_domain` from the request
  - `home_domain_address` matches the **Home Domain Address**
  - `web_auth_domain` matches the **Server**'s domain
  - `client_domain` matches the **Client**'s domain
  - `client_domain_address` matches the **Client Domain Address**
- `network_passphrase`: (optional but recommended) Stellar network passphrase used by the **Server**. This allows a
  **Client** to verify that it's using the correct passphrase when signing and is useful for identifying when a
  **Client** or **Server** have been configured incorrectly.

Example:

```json

##### Error

Every other HTTP status code will be considered an error. For example:

```json
{
  "error": "The provided account has requested too many challenges recently. Try again later."
}
```

### Token

This endpoint accepts a signed challenge transaction, validates it and responds with a session
[JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/) authenticating the account.

The **Client** submits a challenge (that was previously returned by the [`challenge`](#challenge) endpoint) as a HTTP
POST request to `WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT_SEP0045` using one of the following formats (both should be equally supported by the
server):

- Content-Type: `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, body:
  `authorization_entries=<XDR (URL-encoded)>,authorization_entries=<XDR (URL-encoded)>`)
- Content-Type: `application/json`, body: `{"authorization_entries": ["<XDR>", "<XDR>"]}`

To validate the challenge transaction the following steps are performed by the **Server**. If any of the listed steps
fail, then the authentication request must be rejected — that is, treated by the **Server** as an invalid input.

1. Construct a transaction with a single Invoke Host Function operation using the authorization entries returned by the
   client;
1. Simulate the transaction and verify that it succeeds.

The verification process confirms that the **Client** controls the **Client Account** and that the challenge was not
tampered with. Depending on your application this may mean complete signing authority, some threshold of control, or
being a signer of the account. See [Verification](#verification) for examples.

Upon successful verification, **Server** responds with a session JWT, containing the following claims:

- `iss` (the principal that issued a token, [RFC7519, Section 4.1.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.1))
  — a [Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)] for the issuer (`https://example.com` or `https://example.com/G...`)
- `sub` (the principal that is the subject of the JWT,
  [RFC7519, Section 4.1.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.2)) — the **Client Account**'s address
  (`C...`).
- `iat` (the time at which the JWT was issued
  [RFC7519, Section 4.1.6](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.6)) — current timestamp (`1530644093`)
- `exp` (the expiration time on or after which the JWT must not be accepted for processing,
  [RFC7519, Section 4.1.4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.4)) — a server can pick its own expiration
  period for the token (`1530730493`)
- `client_domain` - (optional) a nonstandard JWT claim containing the client home domain, included if the challenge
  transaction contained a `client_domain` (see [Verifying the Client Domain](#verifying-the-client-domain))

The JWT may contain other claims specific to your application, see [RFC7519].

The **Server** should not provide more than one JWT for a specific challenge transaction.

Every other HTTP status code will be considered an error. For example:

```

## Web Authentication Contract

The **Server** must deploy a contract at the `WEB_AUTH_CONTRACT_ID` address specified in the **Server**'s
`stellar.toml`. This contract allows the **Server** to customize authentication logic, including client domain
verification and nonce handling.

The contract must implement the `web_auth_verify` function with the following signature. Within this function, the
contract should call `require_auth` on the address to ensure the client has authorized the operation, and call
`require_auth` on the home domain address so that the **Server** can verify that the challenge has not been tampered.

If the **Server** supports client domain verification, the contract can optionally require a signature from the
`client_domain_address`. All other arguments are ignored by the contract.

```rust
#[contract]
pub struct WebAuthContract;

#[contractimpl]
impl WebAuthContract {
    pub fn web_auth_verify(
        _env: Env,
        address: Address,
        _home_domain: Option<String>, // IGNORED
        home_domain_address: Address,
        _web_auth_domain: Option<String>, // IGNORED
        _client_domain: Option<String>,   // IGNORED
        client_domain_address: Option<Address>,
        _nonce: Option<String>, // IGNORED, used by the Server to ensure challenge is unique
    ) {
        address.require_auth();
        home_domain_address.require_auth();
        // Optional: require a signature from the client domain address
        if let Some(client_domain_address) = client_domain_address {
            client_domain_address.require_auth();
        }
    }
}
```

## Client Recommendations

To prevent unintended side effects in case the `web_auth_verify` invocation operation is executed on the network, the
**Client** should perform the following checks in addition to ensuring there are no sub-invocations in the authorization
entries:

### Verify Invocation Details

For each authorization entry, verify the following:

- **Contract ID**: Ensure it matches the `WEB_AUTH_CONTRACT_ID` specified in the Server's `stellar.toml`.
- **Function Name**: Confirm that the root invocation function is `web_auth_verify`.
- **Arguments**: Verify that the arguments (such as the client account address, home domain, and server domain, etc.)
  match the expected values and are in the same order as described in the
  [Web Authentication Contract](#web-authentication-contract) section.

### Simulate the Transaction

The **Client** should reconstruct the transaction using the authorization entries and simulate its execution. By
simulating the transaction, the **Client** can verify the following:

- **Ledger Footprint Verification**:
  - The transaction's ledger footprint `read_write` set contains only `contract_data` entries where:
    - The `contract` is the **Client Account** address, and the `key` is `ledger_key_nonce`.
    - The `contract` is the **Home Domain Address**, and the `key` is `ledger_key_nonce`.
    - **Optionally**, if client domain verification is used, the `contract` is the **Client Domain Address**, and the
      `key` is `ledger_key_nonce`.

By performing this simulation, the **Client** ensures that:

- The transaction does not have any unintended side effects.
- The **Server** has signed the challenge.

### Signature Expiration Ledger

When signing the authorization entries, the **Client** should set the signature expiration ledger to the current ledger
plus a reasonable buffer. This ensures the signature remains valid for an appropriate duration while preventing replay
attacks. Setting this to the current ledger plus 1 is a reasonable default.

## Verification

### Verifying the Client Domain

A web service requiring SEP-45 authentication may want to attribute each HTTP request made to it to a specific
**Client** software. For example, a web service may want to offer reduced fees for the users of a specific **Client**.

In order to use this optional feature, the organization that provides the **Client** must host a
[SEP-1 stellar.toml](sep-0001.md) file containing a `SIGNING_KEY` attribute (i.e. the **Client Domain Address**). The
`SIGNING_KEY` attribute must be a Stellar public key in the form of a `G` address. The secret key paired with the
`SIGNING_KEY` should be protected as anyone in possession of the secret can verify the **Client Domain**.

This setup allows the **Server** to verify that the challenge returned by the **Client** is also signed by the **Client
Domain Address**, proving that the **Client** is associated with the **Client Domain**. Web services requiring SEP-45
authentication can now attribute requests made with the resulting JWT to the **Client Domain** that signed the
challenge.

**Servers** may chose which **Client Domains** to verify. If the **Client** requests verification of its domain but the
**Server** has no use for verifying that domain, the **Server** should proceed as if the **Client** did not provide the
domain in the request for the challenge transaction. If the **Server** attempts but is unable to fetch the `SIGNING_KEY`
from the provided **Client Domain**, the **Server** should return a `400 Bad Request` HTTP status code.

## JWT Expiration

Servers should select an expiration time for the JWT that is appropriate for the assumptions and risk of the
interactions the **Client** can perform with it. A **Client** may be in control of an account at the time the JWT is
issued but they may lose control of the account through a change in signers. Expiration times that are too long increase
the risk that control on the account has changed. Expiration times that are too short increase the number of times
authentication must reoccur, and a user using a hardware signing device or who must complete a complex signing process
could have a poor user experience.

## A convention for signatures

Signatures in Stellar involve both the secret key of the signer and the passphrase of the network. SEP-45 clients and
servers must use the following convention when deciding what network passphrase to use for signing and verifying
signatures in SEP-45:

- If the server is for testing purposes or interacts with the Stellar testnet, use the Stellar testnet passphrase.
- Otherwise, use the Stellar pubnet passphrase.

This convention ensures that SEP-45 clients and servers can use the same passphrase as they're using for interacting
with the Stellar network.

The client can examine the `network_passphrase` (if defined) that the server includes in its response from the challenge
endpoint to be sure it's using the correct passphrase and is connecting to the server that it expected.

## JWT best practices

When generating and validating JWTs it's important to follow best practices. The IETF is in the process of producing a
set of best current practices when using JWTs: [IETF JWT BCP].
